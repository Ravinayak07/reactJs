            CSS can be used in three types:
            1. internal
            2. inline (means one line) > not good because it will be hectic when u hav large code base
            3. external

        <p id="bla">Internal CSS</p>
        <p stye="color: pink; font-size: 50px;">Inline CSS</p>
    
        <script src="script.js"></script>
         <!--
            WHY script tag should be ket at the bottom of body tag
        > Because
        A html file loads from top to bottom. First heads loads, then body.
        If we keep js file at the top, then the website will take little to load as
        js is a heavy file(as it will have all logics,funs,etc)
        thats why js file is kept at bottom, so that the UI of the website gets load
        first and the user sees it otherwise user will be frustated.
        -->
    </body>
</html>


<!---
href="styles.css" or href="./styles.css"  => in the same folder where index.html is present

href="./xyz/xyz.css" => inside a folder 

./ says search in your surrounding, if file is there then its like ./styles.css and
if its inside another folder of the surrounding, then its like ./xyz/xyz.css
